                <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">The COVID-19 pandemic brought with it several health and healthcare challenges. With shortness of breath being one of the hallmark symptoms of the disease, Kshitij Goel, a Grade 4 student of Shiv Nadar School, Faridabad, came up with a brilliant innovation that is a much-needed medical equipment in current times. Sanjeevani, developed by this talented boy, is an automated bag valve mask that can act as a provisional ventilator machine for people suffering from acute respiratory diseases like COVID-19.

                    Goel, who has an excellent scientific acumen, has been given a double promotion by his school in the academic year 2020-21 to provide him with necessary challenges and bring out the best in him. Let’s have a quick chat with this young gun!

                    Tell us about Sanjeevani, the medical device you’ve created. What is it, and what makes it special?
                    I wanted to make a device that helps patients who were suffering from or have recovered from acute respiratory diseases like COVID-19. I named my device ‘Sanjeevani’ which means ‘one that brings back life.’ I used a manual device called resuscitator or bag valve mask and automated its working to act as a provisional ventilator machine. Sanjeevani can be used during the process of patient recovery, after they have been shifted out of the ICU. The device is useful for patients who can breathe but have weak lungs and need help in breathing, and can be deployed by healthcare staff or the patient’s relatives. Sanjeevani is easy to install and configure.

                    How did you go about developing this equipment? What were the main challenges you faced?
                    I used a BBC microbit to control a continuous servo which was being powered by a 6V battery. A plastic rack and pinion arrangement converted the rotating motion of the servo into linear motion, which was compressing a silicon bag valve mask to create the movement of air. I did face a few challenges, but overcame them eventually! Using MIT research papers, I learned the specifications for the mechanical ventilator which helped me decide various test and configuration settings.</p>

                <img src="Self_sanitising%20BENCH.jpg" class="img-responsive col-lg-5 col-md-5 col-sm-5 col-xs-12">

                <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">All that extra time in the pandemic has led to a lot of innovations and experimentations across all age groups. One such instance is of this quintet of Class 10 girls from Shiv Nadar School. They have created SAFE, a self-sanitising bench installed with UV sterilising light that can reduce the risk of transmitting infections like Viral Conjunctivitis, Influenza and Hepatitis A, besides Covid-19.Made under the Capstone Project, the bench was exhibited at the annual tech event Colloquium 2020 of the school. Now, the five students – Nirvani Jain, Arshia Jaitli, Suhani Sharma, Gurnoor Kaur, and Mansi Aggarwal – plan to install such benches in and around the school premises in Faridabad.

                    “A prototype has already been installed and is waiting to be tested at a large scale. The students are looking forward to reactions from their peers and working towards a Version 2.0,” says IT Head and mentor Mark Nelson.

                    Due to the restricted movement and limited outdoor activity in pandemic, shares Nirvani, they thought of creating something that could help in sanitisation and safety in the outdoor spaces. “Collectively, we felt a sanitising bench was the best contribution for helping people using public space across hospitals, parks, malls, and other outdoor areas,” adds Mansi.</p>
